	abstract="The output of modern cryptographic primitives like pseudorandom generators and block or stream ciphers is frequently required to be indistinguishable from a truly random data. The existence of any distinguisher provides a hint about the insufficient confusion and diffusion property of an analyzed function. In addition to targeted cryptoanalysis, statistical tests included in batteries such as NIST STS, Dieharder or TestU01 are frequently used to assess the indistinguishability property. However, the tests included in these batteries are either too simple to spot the common biases (like the Monobit test) or overly complex (like the Fourier Transform test) requiring an extensive amount of data. We propose a simple, yet surprisingly powerful method called BoolTest for the construction of distinguishers based on an exhaustive search for boolean function(s). The BoolTest typically constructs distinguisher with fewer input data required and directly identifies the function's biased output bits. We analyze the performance on four input generation strategies: counter-based, low hamming weight, plaintext-ciphertext block combination and bit-flips to test strict avalanche criterion. The BoolTest detects bias and thus constructs distinguisher in a significantly higher number of rounds in the round-reduced versions of DES, 3-DES, MD5, MD6 and SHA-256 functions than the state-of-the-art batteries. Finally, we provide a precise interpretation of BoolTest verdict (provided in the form of Z-score) about the confidence of a distinguisher found. The BoolTest clear interpretation is a significant advantage over standard batteries consisting of multiple tests, where not only a statistical significance of a single test but also aggregated decision over multiple, potentially correlated tests, needs to be correctly performed.",

We are pleased to observe that about 1 in 10 systems support ECC across the TLS and SSH protocols. However, we find that despite the high stakes of money, access and resources protected by ECC, implementations suffer from vulnerabilities similar to those that plague previous cryptographic systems.",

This modification permits factoring $n$ in $O(n^{1/3})$ elementary operations, where addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or the extraction of a square root is considered as an elementary operation. A principal part is played by the use of a dissection of the continuum similar to the Farey dissection. This has been programmed for $n \leqq 1.05 \times 10^{20}$ on the CDC 6400.},

	title={Bulletproofs: Short Proofs for Confidential Transactions and More}, 
	year={2018},
	pages={315-334},
	abstract={We propose Bulletproofs, a new non-interactive zero-knowledge proof protocol with very short proofs and without a trusted setup; the proof size is only logarithmic in the witness size. Bulletproofs are especially well suited for efficient range proofs on committed values: they enable proving that a committed value is in a range using only 2 log_2(n)+9 group and field elements, where n is the bit length of the range. Proof generation and verification times are linear in n. Bulletproofs greatly improve on the linear (in n) sized range proofs in existing proposals for confidential transactions in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Moreover, Bulletproofs supports aggregation of range proofs, so that a party can prove that m commitments lie in a given range by providing only an additive O(log(m)) group elements over the length of a single proof. To aggregate proofs from multiple parties, we enable the parties to generate a single proof without revealing their inputs to each other via a simple multi-party computation (MPC) protocol for constructing Bulletproofs. This MPC protocol uses either a constant number of rounds and linear communication, or a logarithmic number of rounds and logarithmic communication. We show that verification time, while asymptotically linear, is very efficient in practice. The marginal cost of batch verifying 32 aggregated range proofs is less than the cost of verifying 32 ECDSA signatures. Bulletproofs build on the techniques of Bootle et al. (EUROCRYPT 2016). Beyond range proofs, Bulletproofs provide short zero-knowledge proofs for general arithmetic circuits while only relying on the discrete logarithm assumption and without requiring a trusted setup. We discuss many applications that would benefit from Bulletproofs, primarily in the area of cryptocurrencies. The efficiency of Bulletproofs is particularly well suited for the distributed and trustless nature of blockchains. The full version of this article is available on ePrint.},

In previous LWE-based FHE schemes, multiplication is a complicated and expensive step involving ``relinearization''. In this work, we propose a new technique for building FHE schemes that we call the approximate eigenvector method. In our scheme, for the most part, homomorphic addition and multiplication are just matrix addition and multiplication. This makes our scheme both asymptotically faster and (we believe) easier to understand.",

The main appeal of our scheme is the conceptual simplicity.",

Our constructions extend naturally to arithmetic circuits with arbitrary fan-in gates thereby further reducing the circuit depth. Building on this ABE system we obtain the first reusable circuit garbling scheme that produces garbled circuits whose size is the same as the original circuit plus an additive poly($\lambda$,d) bits, where $\lambda$ is the security parameter and d is the circuit depth. All previous constructions incurred a multiplicativepoly($\lambda$) blowup.",

This provides an alternative to the Smart-Vercauteren (SV) ciphertext-packing technique that relies on polynomial-CRT. While the SV technique is only applicable to schemes that rely on ring-LWE (or other hardness assumptions in ideal lattices), the PVW method can be used also for cryptosystems whose security is based on standard LWE (or more broadly on the hardness of ``General-LWE'').",

For example the pseudo primality test in GNU Crypto 1.1.0 uses a fixed set of bases. This paper shows how this flaw can be exploited to break the SRP implementation in GNU Crypto. The attack is demonstrated by explicitly constructing pseudoprimes that satisfy the parameter checks in SRP and that allow a dictionary attack. This dictionary attack would not be possible if the pseudo primality test were correctly implemented.",

%abstract="Canetti and Fischlin have recently proposed the security notion universal composability for commitment schemes and provided two examples. This new notion is very strong. It guarantees that security is maintained even when an unbounded number of copies of the scheme are running concurrently, also it guarantees non-malleability and security against adaptive adversaries. Both proposed schemes use $\Theta$(k) bits to commit to one bit and can be based on the existence of trapdoor commitments and non-malleable encryption.",

%abstract="It is well-known that n players, connected only by pairwise secure channels, can achieve unconditional broadcast if and only if the number t of cheaters satisfies t < n/3. In this paper, we show that this bound can be improved - at the sole price that the adversary can prevent successful completion of the protocol, but in which case all players will have agreement about this fact. Moreover, a first time slot during which the adversary forgets to cheat can be reliably detected and exploited in order to allow for future broadcasts with t < n/2. This even allows for secure multi-party computation with t < n/2 after the first detection of such a time slot.",

%abstract="Substantial efforts have been spent on characterizing the round complexity of various cryptographic tasks. In this work we study the round complexity of secure multiparty computation in the presence of an active (Byzantine) adversary, assuming the availability of secure point-to-point channels and a broadcast primitive. It was recently shown that in this setting three rounds are sufficient for arbitrary secure computation tasks, with a linear security threshold, and two rounds are sufficient for certain nontrivial tasks. This leaves open the question whether every function can be securely computed in two rounds. We show that the answer to this question is ``no'': even some very simple functions do not admit secure 2-round protocols (independently of their communication and time complexity) and thus 3 is the exact round complexity of general secure multiparty computation. Yet, we also present some positive results by identifying a useful class of functions which can be securely computed in two rounds. Our results apply both to the information-theoretic and to the computational notions of security.",

%abstract="In the setting of universal composability [Can01], commitments cannot be implemented without additional assumptions such as that of a publicly available common reference string[CF01]. Here, as an alternative to the commitments in the common reference string model, the use of random oracles to achieve universal composability of commitment protocols is motivated. Special emphasis is put on the security in the situation when the additional ``helper functionality'' is replaced by a realizable primitive. This contribution gives two constructions which allow to turn a given non-interactive commitment scheme into a non-interactive universally composable commitment scheme in the random oracle model. For both constructions the binding and the hiding property remain valid when collision-free hash functions are used instead of random oracles. Moreover the second construction in this case even preserves the property of perfect binding.",

%abstract="Unconditionally secure multi-party computations in general, and broadcast in particular, are impossible if any third of the players can be actively corrupted and if no additional information-theoretic primitive is given. In this paper, we relativize this pessimistic result by showing that such a primitive can be as simple as noisy communication channels between the players or weakly correlated pieces of information. We consider the scenario where three players have access to random variables X, Y, and Z, respectively, and give the exact condition on the joint distribution PXYZunder which unconditional broadcast is possible. More precisely, we show that this condition characterizes the possibility of realizing so-called pseudo-signatures between the players. As a consequence of our results, we can give conditions for the possibility of achieving unconditional broadcast between n players and any minority of cheaters and, hence, general multi-party computation under the same condition.",

%abstract="We study the problem of Secure Multi-party Computation (SMC) in a model where individual processes contain a tamper-proof security module, and introduce the TrustedPals framework, an efficient smart card based implementation of SMC for any number of participating entities in such a model. Security modules can be trusted by other processes and can establish secure channels between each other. However, their availability is restricted by their host, that is, a corrupted party can stop the computation of its own security module as well as drop any message sent by or to its security module. We show that in this model SMC can be implemented by reducing it to a fault-tolerance problem at the level of security modules. Since the critical part of the computation can be executed locally on the smart card, we can compute any function securely with a protocol complexity which is polynomial only in the number of processes (that is, the complexity does not depend on the function which is computed), in contrast to previous approaches.",

%abstract="Cryptographic assumptions regarding tamper proof hardware tokens have gained increasing attention. Even if the tamper-proof hardware is issued by one of the parties, and hence not necessarily trusted by the other, many tasks become possible: Tamper proof hardware is sufficient for universally composable protocols, for information-theoretically secure protocols, and even allow to create software which can only be used once (One-Time-Programs). However, all known protocols employing tamper-proof hardware are either indirect, i.e., additional computational assumptions must be used to obtain general two party computations or a large number of devices must be used. In this work we present the first protocol realizing universally composable two-party computations (and even trusted One-Time-Programs) with information-theoretic security using only one single tamper-proof device issued by one of the mutually distrusting parties.",

%abstract="An additively-homomorphic encryption scheme enables us to compute linear functions of an encrypted input by manipulating only the ciphertexts. We define the relaxed notion of a semi-homomorphic encryption scheme, where the plaintext can be recovered as long as the computed function does not increase the size of the input ``too much''. We show that a number of existing cryptosystems are captured by our relaxed notion. In particular, we give examples of semi-homomorphic encryption schemes based on lattices, subset sum and factoring. We then demonstrate how semi-homomorphic encryption schemes allow us to construct an efficient multiparty computation protocol for arithmetic circuits, UC-secure against a dishonest majority. The protocol consists of a preprocessing phase and an online phase. Neither the inputs nor the function to be computed have to be known during preprocessing. Moreover, the online phase is extremely efficient as it requires no cryptographic operations: the parties only need to exchange additive shares and verify information theoretic MACs. Our contribution is therefore twofold: from a theoretical point of view, we can base multiparty computation on a variety of different assumptions, while on the practical side we offer a protocol with better efficiency than any previous solution.",

Using only a single stateful token, one can implement general statistically secure two-party computation (D{\"o}ttling, Kraschewski, M{\"u}ller-Quade; TCC 2011); though all security is lost if an adversarial token receiver manages to physically reset and rerun the token.

Motivated by the ubiquitous use of secure hardware in many real world security applications, Katz (EUROCRYPT 2007) proposed a model of tamper-proof hardware as a UC-setup assumption. An important aspect of this model is whether the hardware token is allowed to hold a state or not. Real world examples of tamper-proof hardware that can hold a state are expensive hardware security modules commonly used in mainframes. Stateless, or resettable hardware tokens model cheaper devices such as smartcards, where an adversarial user can cut off the power supply, thus resetting the card's internal state.",

%abstract="One of the most fundamental notions of cryptography is that of simulation. It stands behind the concepts of semantic security, zero knowledge, and security for multiparty computation. However, writing a simulator and proving security via the use of simulation is a nontrivial task, and one that many newcomers to the field often find difficult. In this tutorial, we provide a guide to how to write simulators and prove security via the simulation paradigm. Although we have tried to make this tutorial as stand-alone as possible, we assume some familiarity with the notions of secure encryption, zero-knowledge, and secure computation.",

abstract="Gathering and processing sensitive data is a difficult task. In fact, there is no common recipe for building the necessary information systems. In this paper, we present a provably secure and efficient general-purpose computation system to address this problem. Our solution---Sharemind---is a virtual machine for privacy-preserving data processing that relies on share computing techniques. This is a standard way for securely evaluating functions in a multi-party computation environment. The novelty of our solution is in the choice of the secret sharing scheme and the design of the protocol suite. We have made many practical decisions to make large-scale share computing feasible in practice. The protocols of Sharemind are information-theoretically secure in the honest-but-curious model with three computing participants. Although the honest-but-curious model does not tolerate malicious participants, it still provides significantly increased privacy preservation when compared to standard centralised databases.",
